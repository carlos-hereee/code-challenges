Understanding the Problem

Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters.
    This new word must meet two criteria:
*   it must be greater than the original word
*   it must be smallest word that meets first condition
*	I can only use the original letters


For example: 
	given the word W= abcd, the next greater word is abdc the greater the position
	the alphabet the greater the value
	because "a" > "b" is false
	and 	"a" < "b" is true it can be view as
			 1  > 2	 is false
			 1  < 2	 is true

Find the Greater string if it is the same return no answer

Plan 
	- traverse the string from right to left
	- as you are traversing compare the letter you are on to next one
		 until you find a smaller letter
	- if found swap the letters 
	- from the current place letters in accessing order
